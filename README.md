Code.html is pynb code with the following strategies:
Small (10) and large portfolio (20)
Equal weight
Inverse to correlation
Inverse to variance
Inverse to covariance 
evaluated with variance 

Research Report.pdf is a report written by friends and me. Detailing the theory and results from the code. 

Conclusion, crypto is not a viable way to store money with aforementioned strategies.
